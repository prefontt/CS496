inputChar(): 
	This function is meant to print an ascii value. First return rand is returned to get the ASCII values but add 32 to skip the first 32.

inputString():
	Since the first function returns ascii values. This part is meant to get the code to output an error message. A string is created to hold 5 ascii characters of choice. Then int is randomized and would go through an if statement and if equal to 1 then the reset is printed. If not then a loop cfraeted would fill the string with 5 random characters returned from inputchar(). Then string s would be returned. So the program doesn't run for a long time it will print out 5 random characters from the for loop. 

The program can be run by doing
	1. gcc -o testme testme.c
	2. testme
