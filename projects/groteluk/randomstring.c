 Within the function testme() inputChar() is called passing the current value of 'state'.  Within inputChar() if the value of 'state' is less than 9 a random character with an ascii value from 32 to 125 is generated and returned.  The range of ascii values from 32 to 125 produces values to increase the state value in testme().  If the value of 'state' is equal to or greater than 9 a random character with an ascii value from 101 to 116 is generated.  The smaller range of ascii values is used because the domain of characters needed to generate an error once the value of 'state' is equal to 9 is only found from 101 to 116.  The inputString() function uses the inputChar() function to generate the random characters in the string and is bound by the current state in deciding what range of ascii characters are randomly generated.  The inputString() function only generates strings with a length of 5 random characters.
