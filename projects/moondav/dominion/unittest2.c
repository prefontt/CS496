Description:
    This unit test will test the discardCard() function in dominion.c.
    The following are key points the test will check:
    - The player's hand count is decremented by 1 after discard
    - The player's discard count is incremented by 1 after discard
    - The number of cards in a player's hand does not exceed the max allowed
    - The number of cards in a player's hand is never less than 0
    - No state changes should occur for other players
    - The deck count does not change
    - Played card pile should increase by 1 after a trashed card

Note: Some skeleton code for game setup was taken from cardtest4.c,
    which was posted to the OSU CS-362 course web page.
