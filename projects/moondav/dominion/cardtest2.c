cardtest2.c

Description:
    This test will test the village card in dominion.c.
    The following are key points the test will check:
    - The current player's number of actions increases by 1 (-1 for
      playing the test card, and +2 from the card details)
    - The current player's hand count increases by 1
    - The current player's deck count decreases by 1
    - The current player's played card count increases by 1

Note: Some skeleton code for game setup was taken from cardtest4.c,
    which was posted to the OSU CS-362 course web page.

Include the following lines in your makefile:

cardtest2: cardtest2.c dominion.o rngs.o
    gcc -o cardtest2 -g cardtest2.c dominion.o rngs.o $(CFLAGS)
