The first thing I did was look at the source code for the testme.c program.
I noticed right away that inputString function had to produce a varity of ascii character with both letters and characters.
I also noticed that inputString function had to be an char array of size 6,
and the letters that this function was producing was lowercase letters.
Lastly I noticed that the last character that was in the char array was the null character.

After I analyzed the source code I looked up how to generat a random value.
From there I googled the ASCII table and came up with values that would fit in the test.
After that I wrote the two functions and tested them and was able to get the mathcing code.
Which is reset in order to produce the error and end the program.
