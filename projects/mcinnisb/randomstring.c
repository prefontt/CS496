 * The inputChar() function has an array of the characters {'[', '(', '{', ' ',
 * 'a', 'x', ')','}', ']', 'z'}. A random number between 0 and 9 is chosen to 
 * pick the index of the character returned from the function ('z' is included in
 * the array, since this will be false for all of the if conditionals).
 *
 * The inputString() function has an array of strings {"reset", "rrr", "foo", "bar",
 * "baz", "figaro", "hello", "world", "rese", "eset"}. A random number between 0 and
 * 9 is chosen to pick the index of the character returned from the function
 * (the more strings in the array, the less likely it will be that "reset" is
 * chosen at the same time that state = 9, with the effect being that there will
 * be more iterations of the while loop.
