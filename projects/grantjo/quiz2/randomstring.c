  I tackled this assignment by first looking over the testme() function. I saw that there is a distinct subset of 9 characters that control the state and a distinct subset of 5 characters that make up the target string 
"reset\0". In order for the error message to be displayed the inputChar must match the current state variable before it can proceed.

[ goes with 0
( with 1
{ with 2
' ' with 3
a with 4
x with 5
} with 6
) with 7
] with 9

Once you reach a state you never go back and the program must  reach state 9 prior to the string helping at all. Once you are at state 9 the inputString must be 6 characters long in the order "reset\0"

The instructions say that the inputString and inputChar must be randomly generated. I decided that limiting the choices of the string to the 5 relevant characters r, s, e, t, \0 and limiting the inputChar options to the ones displayed above the program will have a better chance of reaching the error message. To achieve the random specification of the assigment I was able to just randomly index an array of the relevant characters.

inputChar: 
  I created an array of char's containing the 9 state characters and every time inputChar is called i create a random index between 0 and 8, using rand() % 8, and then return the character at that index in the array.

inputString:
  I created an array of char's containing the 5 needed to build the desired string (r, s, e, t, \0). I then allocate a string of length 6 and randomly index the character option array to build the random string. This is then returned.


To compile this program run the following:

gcc testme.c -o testme
