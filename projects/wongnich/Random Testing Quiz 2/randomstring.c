In order to allow the tester to correctly output the error, the testme function has to receieve the characters: [({ ax})] from the inputChar function one at a time. The way I made the inputChar() function is to have it randomly return 1 char from the accepted chars list. This makes it so it will slowly progress through the "statetes". Once it arrives at state 8, in order to reach the error output, the randomtester needs to receive the string "reset" from the inputString() function. In order to make it random, I first created the correct string and then randomized its order with a large for loop. This will make it so that the test function will have to iterate through the inputString() function for a while before it receives the "reset" string and thus exiting.
