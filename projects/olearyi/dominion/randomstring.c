I saw that the error needed a sequence of characters in a specific order. I emplemented a random character generator for  inputChar(). This allowed the state to iterate through all of the steps up to 9. At this point the progress required that the string s generates 'reset'. To complete this I created an array of char that randomly are inserted into the positions 0-4 of the char array. Eventually 'reset' is passed back through the inputString() and this allows the last portion of the combination to be met and the error is thrown.
