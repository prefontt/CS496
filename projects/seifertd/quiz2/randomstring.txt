To properly test the testme() function, I had to consider all possible and reasonable combinations of both the inputChar() and inputString() functions. For inputChar(), I felt that the ASCII range between 32 and 126 was reasonable because it encompasses all "visible characters" on the ASCII chart. inputString() on the other hand returns a 5 character string ending with a null character (so 6 characters total) where each character is randomly chosen from the alphabet. I had to allocate memory in this function to return the correct data type, so I made sure to free the memory in the testme() loop to prevent potential memory leaks in the testing phase. After compiling the newly written functions and clearing up minor syntax errors, I ran the program and successfully had testme() exit after the 6,579,132nd iteration.
