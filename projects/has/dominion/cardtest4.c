/* Function Name: Assert True
 * Description: Compares 2 values and prints out message if the values are not the same
 * Parameters: int val1 - value that needs to be checked
 *             int val2 - value that is being compared against
 *             char* testName - name of the test
 *             char* cardName - name of the card
 *             int testCase - test case id
 *             int* passFlag - pointer to int storing pass/fail
 * Pre-Conditions: game should be initialized
 * Post-Conditions: if the val1 and val2 are not the same an error message will print and the passFlag will be set to 1
